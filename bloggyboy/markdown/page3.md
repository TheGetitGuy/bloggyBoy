# Music, can be Life.

I dont know about you, but I love music that exudes feelings. I usually listen to bands like *Peach Pit*. I love their odd style
having way to fucking many guitars, and their vocals that somehow excite me, depress me, and tell a story.

There are certain times where I'm feeling a bit more... Retro? Those time usually lead me to finding old record collections on the
Internet Archive and enjoying 1940s music, and its focus on sparkling brass, and grand feeling orchestations. This music is not
the typical tunes an enjoyer of bands like *Chairlife* and *Phantograms* would listen to, but I find the depth of music to be the
most important part.

### Highs and Lows

My favorite songs are quiet, they temper your expectations and give the sound stage room to grow. Then before you know it, the songs
counter that quietness with a cacophony of noise that plays with your ears. A constant barage of sound blends together without 
being able to breathe. Songs that intelligently use silence to play with the listener's ears are some of the best.

### Finally?

So what does this have to do with development and technology?

Man, I dont know, I just like anything creative. You can't tell me you don't listen to music too you poser.
