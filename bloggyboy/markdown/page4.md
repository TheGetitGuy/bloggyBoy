# It fucking sucks

---
I am a real developer, I promise you. Since I've stated my credentials to you I will now present my case.
Next.js is garbage, because it uses Javascript. This framework is awesome and I can see why so many people enjoy it, but have you
ever stopped to consider that maybe you shouldn't let Next slide just because of its usability and practical applications?
## NO!
Get fucking angry. So many hours of talent and work are constantly wasted on this bullshit language. A language so bad that
people have to make languages and transpilers just to make the damn thing managable, is at the core of the thing you love, and you
are just okay with that? Stick to your morals and stop the abuse. Next.js needs a real partner like Python, or Lua. Languages that
have class. ba dum tiss.

### In conclusion

I have no problems with Next.js. In fact I really enjoy using it when I do. The tools it provides to wrangle React into a usable form 
is appreciated greatly. I'll even say I love JavaScript, but maybe this is just an unhealthy dependency? Either way, I can promise you
I'll use Next.js again, and JavaScript is not going away for at least a week, and that is impressive for anything on the internet.
