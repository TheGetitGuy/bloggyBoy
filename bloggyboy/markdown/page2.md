I have created this blog to document my rise in the software development world. One that Has truly been 100% deserved, I promise you.

### *I'm kidding I swear*
I know Im not anywhere near being a good developer
So now that I have you here. Let us begin.

I started my web development career, honestly very 
recently. After being constantly upset about not being able to become good enough at art, I was inspired to try my hand at working in a position where people who know nothing are often able to get paid... _Web Development_

I threw myself into code. Quickly hitting a brick wall with how dense this shit seemed. I don't know what a type even fucking __IS__. One night while fiddling with Microsofts Makecode:Arcade, It hit me. 

## JavaScript

This looks like a fantastic shitty language I could lie about knowing. 

It was that or Python.. and lets be *honest*, I wanted a job.
So there I went, loaded up some online editor and started making some really bad fake websites. Instant gratification. Obviously being able to see graphics in a browser meant I was a **REAL** smart developer. I've since learnt that I was already better than Musk. Naive me had so much to learn. Didn't even know what a react was. I didn't even know how to use LOOPS.

## GGG
This fucking soul, This amazing woman came out of nowhere and made it click. My brain finally could understand concepts and see possibilities that I had never considered real before. We didn't even speak much but this person this **Great Gamer Gal** effected my learning process so much, and I owe everything to this person.

There are few times in your life someone pops in and gives you all the tools you need at one specific time.
Basically the programming angel sent to me to get me to wake the fuck up and get past the boring fundies. So, I did what any smart person would do in this situation
